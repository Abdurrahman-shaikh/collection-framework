Sure, I've formatted the README.md file for your project:

# Collection Framework in C

This project implements a collection framework in C, providing data structures such as HashMap, LinkedList, Binary Search Tree (BST), and ArrayList (dynamic array). Each data structure is implemented with its respective header and source files, allowing for easy integration into your projects.

## Directory Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

```
.
├── include
│   ├── arraylist.h
│   ├── bst.h
│   ├── hashmap.h
│   └── linkedlist.h
├── src
│   ├── arraylist.c
│   ├── bst.c
│   ├── hashmap.c
│   └── linkedlist.c
├── test
│   └── main.c
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```

- `include`: Contains header files for each data structure.
- `src`: Contains source files for each data structure.
- `test`: Contains a test file `main.c` for testing the functionality of each data structure.
- `LICENSE`: Contains the license information for the project.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the project.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

To use the collection framework in your project, include the respective header file (`#include "arraylist.h"`, `#include "bst.h"`, etc.) in your source files and link the corresponding object files during compilation.

Example usage can be found in the `test/main.c` file.
```

This should make it more readable and structured. Let me know if you need further assistance!
