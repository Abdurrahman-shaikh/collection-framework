## Directory Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:


- `include`: Contains header files for each data structure.
- `src`: Contains source files for each data structure.
- `test`: Contains a test file `main.c` for testing the functionality of each data structure.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the project.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdurrahman-shaikh/collection-framework.git

4. Compile the project:

```bash
make
```
